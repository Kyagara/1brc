package main

/*
## Rules and limits
* No external library dependencies may be used
* The computation must happen at application _runtime_, i.e. you cannot process the measurements file at _build time_ and just bake the result into the binary
* Input value ranges are as follows:
    * Station name: non null UTF-8 string of min length 1 character and max length 100 bytes, containing neither `;` nor `\n` characters. (i.e. this could be 100 one-byte characters, or 50 two-byte characters, etc.)
    * Temperature value: non null double between -99.9 (inclusive) and 99.9 (inclusive), always with one fractional digit
* There is a maximum of 10,000 unique station names
* Line endings in the file are `\n` characters on all platforms
* Implementations must not rely on specifics of a given data set, e.g. any valid station name as per the constraints above and any data distribution (number of measurements per station) must be supported
* The rounding of output values must be done using the semantics of IEEE 754 rounding-direction "roundTowardPositive"
